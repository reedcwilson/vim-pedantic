# pedantic.vim

Allow vim to enforce a certain writing style to maintain consistency and
professionalism.

## Installation
If you don't have a preferred installation method or if you use
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) use the following commands:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https:github.com/reedcwilson/vim-pedantic.git

## Usage
Pedantic targets files with a `.blog` suffix. Make sure that your files have
this suffix and all of the custom scripts will apply. Feel free to modify them
to match your custom writing style.
